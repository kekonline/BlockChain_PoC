### 🔐 Smart Contracts & Solidity Basics

**1. Smart Contract Basics**

> Learn how to write, compile, and deploy basic smart contracts in Solidity using tools like Hardhat.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: A simple "Hello Blockchain" or a basic storage contract.

> Learn how to write, compile, and deploy and advanced smart contracts in Solidity using tools like Hardhat.

**2. Contract Revert Handling (Test Revert)**

> Understand how to trigger and catch reverts in your tests and use `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements properly.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: A contract that reverts if a certain condition (like a balance limit) is not met.

**3. Emit Events & Logging**

> Use `emit` to broadcast important changes in contract state. Useful for frontend communication and off-chain indexing.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Emit an event when a new user joins or a token is transferred.

**4. Generate ABI & Contract Addresses for Frontend Integration**

> Learn how to generate ABI files and pass them to frontend apps (React/Next.js + ethers.js/web3.js).
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Show live contract interaction via a frontend UI.

### 🧪 Testing & Simulation

**5. Unit Testing & Integration Tests**

> Use tools like Hardhat to write comprehensive unit tests for smart contracts.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Test full flows like deposits, withdrawals, and error handling.

**6. Using Mocks for Testing External Dependencies**

> Mock contracts like oracles or tokens for isolated testing.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Mock Chainlink oracle to simulate different price feeds.

**7. Test Reverts & Edge Cases**

> Create tests to check failures — ensure contract fails gracefully in edge cases.

**8. Test Forked Mainnet (Test Fork Node)**

> Use tools like Hardhat’s forking to simulate real mainnet contracts locally.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Interact with live protocols like Aave, Compound using a fork.

**9. Increase EVM Time (evm\_increaseTime)**

> Simulate passing of time to test things like vesting, staking, or time-locked contracts.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: A staking contract where rewards increase over time.

### 🌐 Network & Wallet Integration

**10. Deploy to Multiple Networks**

> Learn to deploy on testnets (Sepolia, Mumbai, Fuji, etc.) and mainnet using Hardhat config.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Deploy same contract on Goerli and Polygon Mumbai, then compare behavior.

**11. Connect Multiple Wallets (Metamask, WalletConnect, etc.)**

> Create dApps that support wallet connections using `wagmi`, `web3modal`, or `rainbowkit`.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Let users mint NFTs or interact with a contract using Metamask or WalletConnect.

**12. Verify Contracts on Block Explorers**

> Automate or script the verification process on Etherscan, Polygonscan, etc.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Add a script to auto-verify a contract after deploy.

### 🔗 Chainlink, Oracles & Automation

**13. Chainlink Price Feeds**

> Fetch live asset prices from Chainlink data feeds.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Display ETH/USD and simulate swaps.

**14. Chainlink VRF (Random Generator)**

> Use Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for secure randomness.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Lottery or random NFT generator.

**15. Chainlink Keepers / Automation**

> Automate functions like payments or upkeep using Chainlink Keepers (now called Automation).
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Auto-close auctions after a time limit.

---

### 🧠 Security & Analysis

**16. Gas Optimization Techniques**

> Learn patterns to reduce gas costs: packing variables, using `uint256` efficiently, etc.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Compare two versions of a function — optimized vs unoptimized.

**17. Static Analysis with Slither**

> Use Slither to analyze your smart contracts for security vulnerabilities and bad patterns.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Run Slither on 2–3 contracts and fix the issues it flags.

---

### 🏦 DeFi & Lending

**18. Aave Lending Protocol Testing (PoC)**

> Interact with the Aave lending pool to deposit, borrow, repay using their SDKs or directly via contracts.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Deposit DAI into Aave and show live interest growth on frontend.

**19. Build a Simple Lending Pool**

> Understand the basics of lending: pool creation, interest, borrowing logic.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Allow users to lend and borrow fake tokens, simulate repayment and interest accrual.

---

### 📁 Decentralized Storage

**20. IPFS, Filecoin, or Fleek Deployment**

> Upload and retrieve files from IPFS using Pinata, NFT.Storage, or Fleek.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Upload a user image or metadata JSON for an NFT.

---

### 🪙 Tokens & Standards

**21. Create ERC-20 Token**

> Learn how to create and deploy your own fungible token.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Deploy a custom token with mint/burn and role-based access.

**22. Tags (Possibly referring to Metadata Tags or NFT Traits)**

> Use metadata to store and display NFT traits or classification.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: NFT collection with random tags like “Rare”, “Epic”.

### ✅ Suggested Additions

Here are a few additions you might want to include:

**23. Gas Reporting & Cost Analysis**

> Use tools like `hardhat-gas-reporter` to understand function costs and improve performance.

**24. Multisig Wallet**

> Build or interact with a Gnosis Safe wallet.
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Require 2-of-3 signatures to execute a transaction.

**25. Meta-Transactions & Gasless UX**

> Let users interact with your contract without paying gas directly (using relayers).
> 📌 *PoC idea*: Sign a message, have backend relay the transaction.
